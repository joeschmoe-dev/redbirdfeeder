# 🍔 Redbird Feeder - Tracking free food & items offered by ISU RSOs
## Experience the easiest way to shamelessly attend an event for food and dip.

Who doesn't love free food? Imagine if you could see when and where free food and items would be offered on campus? Imagine no more! Introducing Redbird Feeder, the one stop shop for all things free on campus.



## ✨ Freeloading Features

- **Easy calendar format**: Universally employable ICS calendar file, works with iOS, Google/Android, PC, etc.
- **Auto-update**: Never miss a meal! Calendar updates periodically, removing old events and adding new ones.  
- **Additional Information**: Each event includes the event name, whether food and/or other free stuff is available, as well as the event description for more details (like what *kinds* of food and/or stuff). 
- **ITS FREE**: What good would it be if an app to locate free food wasn't free?
